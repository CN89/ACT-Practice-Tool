                    <p className="px-20 text-center text-lg text-text">
                    The ACT (American College Testing) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. 
                    It assesses high school students' general educational development and their ability to complete college-level work. 
                    The ACT consists of multiple-choice questions in four subject areas: English, Mathematics, Reading, Science
                    There is also an optional Writing (Essay) section. 
                    Scores from the ACT are used by colleges and universities as part of their admissions process, and they help institutions evaluate a student's readiness for college-level coursework. 
                    It's similar to the SAT, another standardized test for college admissions, but it has a different format and scoring system. 
                    The ACT scores students 1 - 36 for each main subject and averages the results for your composite score.
                    The writing section on the other hand is scored 2 - 12 and does not affect the composite score.
                    Students often take the ACT in their junior or senior year of high school to enhance their college applications.

                    <b>2. Create a Study Schedule:</b>
                    <br></br>
                    Develop a study schedule that fits your availability and the time you have before the test. 
                    Consistency is key, so plan to study regularly. 
                    Break your schedule into manageable segments, and allocate more time to areas where you need improvement.

                    Practice tests are invaluable for understanding your strengths and weaknesses. 
                    Take full-length practice tests under test-like conditions to assess your progress. 
                    Analyze your mistakes and work on improving those areas.

                    Concentrate your efforts on the sections or question types where you struggle the most.

                    <br></br>
                    The ACT includes questions designed to trick test-takers. 
                    Learn strategies like process of elimination and educated guessing.
