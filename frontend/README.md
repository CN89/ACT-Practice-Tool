# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start: frontend`

Runs the frontend app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run dev: backend`
Runs the backend server in development move.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.

### `WARNING`
You must run both for the them to interact. There is already a proxy setup to allow this.

### `Disclaimer`
Last step before this is seen on a brower is the insertion of documents into the database. The script is still under production.
